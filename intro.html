<h2>Introduction</h2>

<section class="informative">
    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>With vision of decentralization of digital world we need to start thinking about how to ditch the idea of finding
        "things" base on their location and refer to the "things" by a cryptographic hash.</p>
    <p>DID were created as a form of decentralized identifier which originally suppose to be able to identify anything
        in the digital and analog world.
        Currently majority of created methods addressing only one side of space which assume controling subject who is in charge of the DID Document which DID points to.
        `did:r:` method propose to use mechanism to point directly to the content itself through cryptographic hash. 
    </p>
    <p>Assumption:
        <ul>
            <li>Immutable</li>
            <li>Persistant</li>
            <li>Interoperable</li>
            <li>Decentralized</li>
            <li>Trustful identifier</li>
        </ul>
        TODO
    </p>

    <h3>Structure</h3>
    <p>`did:r:` use multihash as a numeric did which is strictly related with the content which it points to.</p>

    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <p>R DIDs are suitable for identification of "things" which do not required controloship in the first glance.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>They have no transaction costs, making them essentially free to create, store, and maintain.</li>
        <li>They are independent of any network, storage solution or system</li>
        <li>They allow to verify the content which they points to by simply calculating the hash of the </li>
    </ul>
